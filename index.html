    <h1>FACTS ABOUT CROISSANTS</h1>
    <h3>THERE ARE ONLY EIGHT INGREDIENTS IN A FRENCH CROISSANT RECIPE.</h3>
    <p>
      The eight ingredients that go into making a classic French butter
      croissant (croissant au beurre) are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>butter</li>
      <li>flour</li>
      <li>water</li>
      <li>milk</li>
      <li>yeast</li>
      <li>sugar</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      IN FRANCE, THERE’S A REASON WHY SOME CROISSANTS ARE CURVED AND OTHERS ARE
      STRAIGHT.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The French like full disclosure on what they are eating, so the bakers
      have to let people know what is in their croissants. As a rule of thumb
      (though not all bakers adhere to that standard), croissants that are
      straight are those made with butter (croissants au beurre), and the curved
      ones are made with margarine (croissants ordinaires).
    </p>
    <p>
      The classic butter croissant remains the superior choice since margarine
      croissants tend to be denser, aren’t as fluffy with flakey layers, and
      lack sheen. However, because margarine is much cheaper than butter,
      margarine-based croissants are more common in France than natural butter
      croissants.
